Man, just walked out of Karate Kid: Legends and wow, my mind's like one of those tilted pinball machines, balls bouncing everywhere. Bruce Lee dancing in my head, but it's actually Daniel. No, wait, it's...god my back hurts from these damn seats, I should remember to never pick seats in the back row again. Crunching on popcorn crumbs still. Why do they always get stuck in your teeth so bad?

Anyway, there was this scene where Daniel or was it Miguel? Nah, it wasn’t Miguel... but they were in this old dojo, dust floating around like magic, like those snow orbs with tiny snowflakes that never stop drifting. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 them was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 two eagles fight in slow motion, only if eagles did karate and knew how to quote Miyagi. Also, why is the theater always so noisy nowadays? Can barely hear the soundtrack with all these whispers and candy wrappers.

But there's this new kid, oh man, he’s such a whirlwind of kicks, kinda like a young hot pepper mixed with jet fuel...or something. So cool it made me wish I could stop time, jump into the screen and... what’s that word again?.. spar? spar with them in a weird montage. Haha, reminds me, gotta remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later so I can 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in peace and make sense of all this combat chaos.

>You know that moment when Miyagi’s ghost does a wink or maybe he didn’t I can't even sure anymore... anyhow the nostalgia punched me like a fist wrapped in velvet, all soft and violent at once. My heart feels like it practiced the crane kick but got all dizzy instead. A panda wearing a tuxedo would’ve made just as much sense I think. Does that even make sense? Who knows man, it’s all still just rolling around my brain like a tumbleweed.

My buddy told me to remember who wins in the end but dude LET ME TELL YOU who cares?? It was so good,, really, you were just there for the ride, like a... err, like a paper plane sailing across a stormy sea made of nachos. 

Anyway, gotta go home, recalibrate my mind, maybe get some sleep after a warm cup of... somethin’. Yeah, forget the coffee; my nerves are already wired like a neon sign gone haywire.
